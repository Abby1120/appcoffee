Coffee website using Foundation. For now login form is just validation vanilla JS for prototype purposes. Social Media App will be built after site. 

Building this using Foundation with vanilla javascript and jquery for prototype purposes. Really just trying to familiarize myself with Foundation to use it with Angular. Once I have a prototype built I intend to set the site up with Angular and then the corresponding mobile app to go with it. 

As of 10/24/19 JS login validation is completed. 

As of 12/17/19 index.html page updated down to a temporary footer. Responsiveness on all items works on chrome (still working out some logistical aspects of design), need to test on others. Have started building a Database using MONGODB. Upon completion of Database will set-up a newsletter for interest in the project and a user authentication. Have torn down most of site still have a prototype sign-in with a homepage available.

Sign In Insturactions for now:

Click sign-in button in upperright hand-corner.

To submit sign in form use at least 9 characters in email space and 6 in password space, takes user to About.html for now. 

 12/20 Finishing API and USER DB. Have finished Pages in Angular. Should have Angular front-end connected to API and Authorization by Friday 2/28/20. Just trying to get some Data Modeling right.
