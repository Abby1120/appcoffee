Coffee website using Foundation. For now login form is just validation vanilla JS for prototype purposes. Social Media App will be built after site. 

Building this using Foundation with vanilla javascript and jquery for prototype purposes. Really just trying to familiarize myself with Foundation to use it with Angular. Once I have a prototype built I intend to set the site up with Angular and then the corresponding mobile app to go with it. 

As of 10/24/19 JS login validation is completed. Working on making Login Form look decent. <rant> CSS Frameworks are stupid. I could've done this in 3/4 the time with Vanilla CSS or SASS. It's just a huge PITA learning what framework uses what class names. </rant> 

As of 11/17/19 index.html page updated down to a temporary footer. Responsiveness on all items works on chrome (still working out some logistical aspects of design), need to test on others. Have started building a Database using MONGODB. Upon completion of Database will set-up a newsletter for interest in the project and a user authentication.
